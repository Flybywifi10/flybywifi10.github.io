		<h1>Overview</h1>
	</div>

	<p>This Website helps you to find all the resources that are needed to understand the concept of blockchain and
		cryptocurrencies. The website is designed to help both technical and non-technical audiences. </p>
	<p>Whether you are looking to accelerate your career, earn a degree, or learn something for personal reasons this
		website has something for you.</p>

		<h2>What is a Blockchain?</h2>
	</div>

	<p>A blockchain is a permanent, sequential list of transaction records distributed over a network. Each block in the
		chain contains a hash of the previous block, along with a timestamp and transaction data. This makes the
		blockchain inherently resistant to attack or manipulation.</p>

	<p>Blockchain technology is ideal for recording various types of transactions where data is sensitive or targeted by
		hackers for unauthorized duplication or other fraudulent activity. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies use
		blockchain technology to record transactions. Blockchain for business applications can include the recording of
		contracts, medical records, monetary transactions and much more.</p>

	<div class="about_text">
		<h2>Cryptocurrency</h2>
	</div>

	<p>A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly
		impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks based on blockchain
		technology—a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers. A defining feature of
		cryptocurrencies is that they are generally not issued by any central authority, rendering them theoretically
		immune to government interference or manipulation. </p>

			<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
			<p>The easiest way to define Bitcoin is to call it a “digital dollar.” That’s really all it is — minus all
				the formal regulations that come with a bank (which is what makes it such a disruptive concept). It’s
				not a technology. It’s not a company. It’s your money, held in a digital form.</p>

			<p>Some people buy Bitcoin because they want to store their money somewhere other than a bank. Some buy
				Bitcoin as an investment, believing that its price a few months or years from now will be substantially
				higher than it is today. And some people purchase Bitcoin as a means of investing in companies that
				raise money through an ICO, since equity in those companies cannot be purchased
				with traditional currency. You can only purchase tokens with Bitcoin or Ether, which is Ethereum’s
				cryptocurrency.</p>

			<h2>Ethereum</h2>
			<p>Ethereum is another cryptocurrency, and one many people see as potentially overtaking Bitcoin as the
				dominant coin in the market.</p>

			<p>Ethereum’s coin value is referred to as “Ether,” and just like Bitcoin is bought and sold, and used by
				investors to buy into ICO opportunities.</p>

			<p>The difference between Ethereum and Bitcoin is the fact that Bitcoin is nothing more than a currency,
				whereas Ethereum is a ledger technology that companies are using to build new programs. Both Bitcoin and
				Ethereum operate on what is called “blockchain” technology, however Ethereum’s is far more robust. If
				Bitcoin was version 1.0, Ethereum is 2.0, allowing for the building of decentralized applications to be
				built on top of it.</p>
